# Distributions

The introduction of Distributions marks a significant advancement in web3, offering a scalable method for one-to-many fund transfers.

<Admonition type="info">
  Distributions are currently active on testnets. Relevant addresses and tooling
  support are in progress, including additions to SuperTokenV1Library and SDK
  Core. For more information, visit the [Superfluid  Console](https://console.superfluid.finance/eth-goerli/protocol).

## Overview

Distributions allow for the creation of **pools** with a designated **pool admin** who manages **units** for **pool members**. Members of these pools can receive funds either instantly or through continuous streaming, making this method highly efficient and scalable. There are two types of Distributions:

- **Instant Distributions**: They allow one transaction distribution to any number of receivers with a fixed gas cost.
- **Streaming Distributions**: They allow for continuous distribution of funds to receivers through [Money Streaming](./money-streaming.mdx) to a Pool.

### Definitions

- **Pool**: A channel for proportional token distribution.
- **Distribution**: The action of allocating specified token amounts to receivers.
- **Units**: Represent the proportion of the distribution each subscriber receives.
- **Pool Admin**: The administrator of the distribution process.
- **Subscribers/Pool Member**: Receivers allocated units and eligible to receive tokens through the Index.

### Key Features

- **Pools as Contracts**: Unlike previous approaches, pools in streaming distributions are contracts and can be ERC20 tokens. This allows pool members to transfer units among themselves, which wasn't possible earlier.
- **Roles and Permissions**: A pool admin can grant and revoke units, while any account can act as a **distributor** to execute fund distributions.
- **Distribution Methods**: There are two primary ways to distribute funds:
  - **Instant Distribution**: Calculated as `distributionAmount * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.
  - **Streaming Distribution**: Determined by `poolFlowRate * (poolMemberUnits / poolTotalUnits)`.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The cost of executing distributions remains constant, regardless of the number of pool members.

### High-Level Workflow

1. **Pool Creation**: Any account can create a pool and appoint a pool admin. This pool acts as a channel for distributing funds.
2. **Unit Management**: The pool admin assigns units to members, representing their share in future distributions.
3. **Member Connection**: Pool members can connect to or disconnect from the pool, affecting how they access distributed funds.
4. **Distribution Execution**: Distributors can initiate either instant or streaming distributions, which are then divided among pool members based on their unit share.

## Distribution Examples

### Streaming Distribution Illustration

This diagram shows a distributor streaming funds to various pool members, each holding different unit amounts. Note: A single transaction can cater to multiple members.

### Adjusting Unit Counts

Here, a distributor modifies unit counts for members. This change instantly alters the distribution rate for all members in one transaction. Batch updates can be done using Superfluid's batch call.

### Modifying the Flow Rate

This example demonstrates how a change in the distributor's streaming rate affects the total flow rate of the pool, thus instantly impacting each member's rate.

## Advanced Pool Features

As pools are also ERC20 tokens, they enable:

- **Transfer of Units**: Pool members can freely transfer their units.
- **Delegated Transfers**: Using the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions, units can be transferred on behalf of a member.

These features add composability and flexibility, expanding the potential use cases for pools in web3.

## Handling Odd Numbers: Adjustment Flow Rate

To manage indivisible token amounts due to the absence of floating-point arithmetic in Solidity, distributions use an **adjustment flow rate**. This flow rate is streamed to the pool admin to ensure precise fund allocation.

### Example Scenario

- **Pool Creation**: Alice assigns 3 units each to Bob, Carol, and Dave, totaling 9 units.
- **Streaming Distribution**: Alice initiates a flow of 100 DAIx/second, which isn't divisible by 9.
- **Adjustment Flow Rate**: To address the indivisibility, 99 DAIx/second is streamed to members, with 1 DAIx/second as the adjustment flow to Alice.

In conclusion, streaming distributions offer a robust and scalable solution for distributing funds in web3, backed by the flexibility and efficiency of the underlying technology.
