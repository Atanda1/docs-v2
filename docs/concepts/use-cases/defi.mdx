# DeFi 

Superfluid Protocol brings innovative solutions to the DeFi space, allowing for novel applications in financial management and transactions.

## Dollar-Cost Averaging

Superfluid's automation capabilities extend to the development of recurring investment applications. These applications can stream funds towards investments, providing a hands-off approach to dollar-cost averaging (DCA).

- **Example**: [Ricochet Exchange](https://ricochet.exchange/) demonstrates an application of this concept, where users can automate their investment strategies.

## Automated Savings

Using Superfluid, individuals and organizations can automate their savings or investment allocations. This setup enables a continuous, hassle-free process, effectively creating a "streaming portfolio".

- **Example**: This approach can be used to allocate funds into various investments, like yield-bearing assets or cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Further details can be found in this [article on real-time investing](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/real-time-investing-empowering-the-next-generation-of-investors-b216d6ac8d3f).

## Undercollateralized Lending

Superfluid facilitates undercollateralized lending based on income streams. This system allows businesses or individuals with consistent revenue streams to secure loans without traditional collateral.

- **Process**: A lending contract gains control over a salary or revenue stream, enabling borrowing against future income.
- **Example**: Explore the [Employment Based Loan](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/fc916ffca38749fb79a2a6f22edd3cbadaae7bac/examples/employment-based-loan) for a practical implementation. Additionally, [this video](https://youtu.be/yxzOimYwxHY?t=741) provides a technical breakdown.

## Lending in Streams

Superfluid introduces a new paradigm in on-chain lending, where loan repayments and borrowings are handled through continuous streams rather than lump-sum transactions.

- **Benefit**: This system allows for automated, on-chain loan repayments and gradual borrowing against collateral.
- **Example**: An illustrative project demonstrating this concept can be viewed [here](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/roadtoweb3/the-loan-stream).

## Streaming Options

Superfluid also enables a novel approach to options trading, replacing upfront premium payments with continuous streaming payments.

- **Mechanism**: An option seller receives a continuous stream of payments until the option is exercised by the buyer.
- **Application**: This model is applicable to perpetual options, where the rights are maintained as long as the premium is streamed. For an example, see this [streaming call option project](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/chainshot/examples/archive/streaming-call-option).

## On-Chain Tradeable Cashflow Assets

Tradeable cashflow assets in Superfluid involve using NFTs as pointers for money streams, enabling the transfer of future cashflows on-chain.

- **Functionality**: The transfer of the NFT shifts the cashflow from the previous holder to the new one.
- **Example**: This [basic tradeable cashflow example](../../.gitbook/assets/image_(50).png) showcases how money streams can be tokenized for on-chain trading.
