# Gaming

Superfluid brings a new level of efficiency and scalability to the movement of in-game value. For an in-depth understanding, explore this [article on blockchain gaming with Superfluid streams](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/making-blockchain-gaming-more-immersive-with-superfluid-streams-2b0ff4661aa9).

## Streaming of In-Game Resources

In games, the gradual accumulation of resources, like the Gold Mines and Elixir Collectors in Clash of Clans, is a common mechanism. Superfluid can stream such tokenized resources directly to players' accounts, enabling immediate utilization.

### Applications

- **In-Game Implementation**: Players could purchase a Gold Mine NFT, which then streams gold tokens to them. Upgrading the mine would increase the flow rate.
- **Web3 Adaptation**: This concept parallels the streaming of resources on the blockchain, enhancing real-time engagement and utility.

## Evolving NFTs

Superfluid can be used to create dynamic NFTs that evolve over time based on resource streams.

### Applications

- **Interactive Evolution**: An NFT, such as a flower, could evolve as it receives a stream of specific tokens (e.g., water tokens).
- **Realization**: The project [PlantyBois](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/plantybois-1mc64) demonstrates a collection of evolving NFTs in this manner.

## Guild Membership Models

Superfluid can revolutionize guild membership models in Web3 gaming by financializing guild operations and memberships.

### Applications

- **Subscription Fees**: Guilds could implement automatic on-chain subscription fees through money streams.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Using Superfluid's Distributions, guild earnings could be efficiently distributed to members, or stakes in guild revenue could be tokenized and traded.

Superfluid's integration into gaming paves the way for more immersive and financially intricate gaming experiences in the Web3 ecosystem.
