# Recurring Payments

Superfluid revolutionizes the concept of recurring payments, offering automated and continuous value transfer between accounts. This innovation enables a variety of practical use cases in the realm of decentralized finance.

## Salary Streams

One of the most prominent use cases of Superfluid is real-time salary distribution. Employees can receive their compensation continuously, by the second, instead of traditional pay periods.

### Advantages

- **Improved Cash Flow**: Employees benefit from immediate access to their earnings, aligning closely with their financial needs.
- **Payment Automation**: Salary streams simplify payroll processes, requiring only a single transaction to initiate ongoing payments.
- **Fair Value Exchange**: This model ensures that the value received by employees is in sync with the value they provide.
- **Ecosystem Integrations**: Superfluid streams can be integrated with other applications for enhanced utility, like [Ricochet Exchange](https://ricochet.exchange/), which allows investment of salary streams.

## Automate DAO Payroll

Superfluid streamlines DAO payroll management, offering a frictionless and fee-free method of compensating team members and contributors.

### Key Benefits

1. **Reduced Effort**: Set annual or monthly compensation amounts to be transferred over time without further transactions.
2. **No Overhead**: Manage funds through a single setup rather than monthly administrative tasks.
3. **Simplified Payments**: Directly stream to multiple wallets from a central account like a Gnosis Safe.
4. **Immediate Availability**: Contributors receive real-time payments that are immediately accessible.

## Subscriptions

Superfluid offers a streamlined solution for crypto-native subscriptions, overcoming the challenges of manual recurring authorizations.

### Mechanism

- **Automated Streams**: Subscribers initiate a payment stream once, which continues automatically without further authorization.
- **Business Integration**: Service providers can grant access based on the subscriber's on-chain flow rate.

## Premium Payments

Insurance premium payments can be automated with Superfluid, allowing policyholders to pay as they go rather than upfront.

### Application

- **Continuous Coverage**: Insurance coverage continues as long as the premium stream is active.
- **Flexible Adjustments**: Policyholders can modify their stream for changes in coverage.

## Rentals

Superfluid facilitates the gradual and automated payment of rent through money streams, applicable to both digital and real-world properties.

## Royalty or Dividend Distributions

The Superfluid [Instant Distribution Agreement](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/) enables efficient royalty or dividend distributions to multiple recipients.

### Distribution Mechanics

- **Unit-Based Allocation**: Accounts receive distributions based on their assigned "units", similar to shares.
- **Persistent Units**: Distribution units remain constant, ensuring fair allocation with varying distribution amounts.

## Public Goods or Grant Funding

Superfluid allows for continuous support of public goods and grants, providing both ongoing funding and on-chain proof of contribution.

### Continuous Support

- **Perpetual Streams**: Automatic, ongoing financial support to causes.
- **On-Chain Proof**: Demonstrable, composable proof of contribution for integration with decentralized profiles or NFTs.

Superfluid's approach to recurring payments offers a transformative solution for various financial interactions in the Web3 space.
