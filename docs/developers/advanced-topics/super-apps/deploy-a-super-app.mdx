# Deploy a Super App

## Deploying a Super App

Deploying a Super App involves integration with the Superfluid Protocol and compliance with its governance for activation. For mainnet deployment, you have two options for registration:

1. **Registration Key**: Request a key associated with a deployer account. This key, possibly with an expiry, can be used multiple times via `ISuperfluid.registerAppWithKey()`.
2. **Factory Contract Whitelisting**: Use a factory contract to register an unlimited number of Super Apps via `ISuperfluid.registerAppByFactory()`.

For further guidance and mainnet deployment, refer to these resources:

## SuperAppBaseFlow - Simplifying Super App Development

### What is SuperAppBaseFlow?

SuperAppBaseFlow is an inheritable base contract designed to streamline the development of Super Apps. It abstracts the complexities involved in writing callbacks and reduces redundancy.

*Example: onFlowCreated is a more intuitive function than afterAgreementCreated.*

### Key Features of SuperAppBaseFlow

- **Intuitive Callback Functions**: SuperAppBaseFlow consolidates callback development into three functions (`onFlowCreated`, `onFlowUpdated`, `onFlowDeleted`) with user-friendly parameters.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the callback process compared to the original SuperAppBase, making it more accessible for developers.

#### Importing and Using SuperAppBaseFlow

```solidity
// Example Code
import { SuperAppBaseFlow } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperAppBaseFlow.sol";

contract SomeSuperAppContract is SuperAppBaseFlow {
    // Your contract implementation
}
```

#### Constructor Arguments

```solidity
constructor(
    ISuperfluid host_,
    bool activateOnCreated,
    bool activateOnUpdated,
    bool activateOnDeleted
)
    // Constructor implementation
```

* **`host_`**: Superfluid Host address for your target network.
* **Activation Flags**: Indicate which callbacks (`onFlowCreated`, `onFlowUpdated`, `onFlowDeleted`) your Super App will use.

### Token Acceptance

Override the `isAcceptedSuperToken` function to specify which Super Tokens can trigger the Super App's callbacks.

```solidity
function isAcceptedSuperToken(ISuperToken /*superToken*/) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return true; // Default implementation
}
```

### Callback Functions

#### onFlowCreated

Override for logic when a new flow to the Super App is created.

```solidity
function onFlowCreated(
    ISuperToken superToken,
    address sender,
    bytes calldata ctx
) internal virtual returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {
    // Your logic here
}
```

#### onFlowUpdated

Override for logic when an existing flow to the Super App is updated.

```solidity
function onFlowUpdated(
    ISuperToken superToken,
    address sender,
    int96 previousFlowRate,
    uint256 lastUpdated,
    bytes calldata ctx
) internal virtual returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {
    // Your logic here
}
```

#### onFlowDeleted

Override for logic when an existing flow to the Super App is deleted. Note: This callback must not revert to avoid jailing the Super App.

```solidity
function onFlowDeleted(
    ISuperToken superToken,
    address sender,
    address receiver,
    int96 previousFlowRate,
    uint256 lastUpdated,
    bytes calldata ctx
) internal virtual returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {
    // Your logic here
}
```

## Conclusion

SuperAppBaseFlow is a recommended and easier way to deploy Super Apps, offering a more straightforward approach to developing with Superfluid's innovative features. Its intuitive design and simplified callback functions make it an ideal starting point for developers diving into programmable cash flows.
