# Overview of Super Tokens

Super Tokens enhance the ERC20 token standard by integrating additional functionalities like streams and instant distributions, termed as Super Agreements. Super Tokens exist in two primary forms: Wrapper and Pure.

:::info
Beyond traditional ERC20 capabilities, Super Tokens enable advanced value transfer methods, including money streaming, through Superfluid's functionalities.

## Real-Time Balance

Super Tokens offer a dynamic approach to balance calculation, incorporating both standard transfers and the ongoing effects of Super Agreements.

- **Static Balance**: Traditional ERC20 balance.
- **Real-Time Balances**: Fluctuations due to Super Agreements, either positive or negative.

The actual balance is the sum of these elements, providing a real-time view of an account's funds.

### 1. Wrapper Super Tokens

Wrapper Super Tokens are created from existing ERC20 tokens to include Superfluid's functionalities. They are the most common and can be permissionlessly created for any ERC20 token.

#### Wrapping & Unwrapping

- **Wrapping**: Deposit ERC20 tokens into the Wrapper Super Token contract to mint an equivalent amount of Super Tokens.
- **Unwrapping**: Burn Super Tokens to get back the underlying ERC20 tokens.

#### Custom Wrapper Super Tokens

Custom Wrapper Super Tokens are used when underlying ERC20 tokens have complex functionalities that standard wrappers can't handle.

For detailed deployment steps and further information, visit the [Deploy a Super Token Page](./guides/deploy-super-token.mdx).

### 2. Pure Super Tokens

Pure Super Tokens are independent of any underlying asset, inheriting all Superfluid functionalities directly.

#### Customization

Pure Super Tokens can be customized with additional features like pre-minting, access control, and wallet whitelisting. They can be categorized as Governed or Independent, with Governed Pure Super Tokens recommended for alignment with Superfluid Protocol Governance.

For a step-by-step guide on deploying Pure Super Tokens, refer to the [Pure Super Token Deployment](./guides/deploy-super-token.mdx#deploying-a-pure-super-token) section.

### 3. Native Super Tokens

Native Super Tokens are similar to wrappers but are designed for native assets like ETH, MATIC, or AVAX. Depositing these assets into the Native Super Token contract yields a wrapped version of the asset.

Canonical deployments of Native Super Tokens are available for each chain that Superfluid operates on. For detailed deployment steps and further information, visit the [Deploy a Super Token Page](./guides/deploy-super-token.mdx).

## ERC777 in Super Tokens

### Understanding ERC777

ERC777 is a token standard that builds on ERC20, introducing send/receive hooks and operator accounts for more complex token interactions.

#### Features

- **Send/Receive Hooks**: Custom logic triggered upon sending or receiving ERC777 tokens.
- **Operators**: Accounts authorized to move tokens on behalf of others, triggering relevant hooks.

### Super Token ERC777 Implementation

Super Tokens utilize ERC777 to allow for advanced token interactions.

- **Override of `transferFrom`**: In Super Tokens, this function doesn't trigger hooks, differing from typical ERC777 behavior.
- **Preserving `send` Functionality**: The `send` function is maintained as is, suitable for interactions requiring ERC777 features.
