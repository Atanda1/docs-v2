# Access Control List (ACL)

The Access Control List (ACL) in Superfluid allows any account (either a plain Ethereum account or a smart contract) to configure permissions for another account to manage streams on its behalf. It's akin to the money streaming version of the ERC20 approval mechanism.

Understanding the functions provided by the ACL involves grasping the `flowRateAllowance` and `permissions` parameters.

## `flowRateAllowance` Parameter

The `flowRateAllowance` can be visualized as a tank that you fill to a certain level for the `flowOperator` account through your [`updateFlowOperatorPermissions`](/docs/sdk/sdk-money-streaming.mdx) call. This allowance is then spent by the `flowOperator` as needed. Every increase in a flow rate on your behalf depletes the `flowRateAllowance`, while decreases in your flow rate or deletion of a stream do not affect it.

**Example:**

Imagine giving an operator a `flowRateAllowance` of 1000 tokens per month (equivalent to a flow rate of `385802469135802` tokens per second). If they create a stream with a `flowRate` of 500 tokens per month for you, the remaining `flowRateAllowance` would be 500 tokens per month. Further, if they increase another stream's flow rate by 250 tokens per month, the `flowRateAllowance` reduces to 250 tokens per month.

## `permissions` Parameter

The `permissions` value, ranging from 1 to 7, specifies the level of access an operator has over your streams. This is set when calling [`updateFlowOperatorPermissions`](sdk-core/updateflowoperatorpermissions.md).

| Permission Type           | Parameter Value |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Create                    | 1               |
| Update                    | 2               |
| Create or Update          | 3               |
| Delete                    | 4               |
| Create or Delete          | 5               |
| Delete or Update          | 6               |
| Create, Update, or Delete | 7               |
