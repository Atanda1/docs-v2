# Pools

Superfluid's [`SuperTokenV1Library.sol`](/docs/technical-reference/intro) is a comprehensive library that enables interactions with all of the Superfluid components (including Pools) through the SuperToken interface. In this page we will show you the most relevant functions from this library to interact with Pools through the Super Token interface.

## What is a Pool?

A pool is a smart contract that facilitates the distribution of tokens to multiple members, managed by a pool admin. Members hold units within the pool that determine their proportion of the distribution.

:::note

The Superfluid Pool implements basic ERC20 functionality, allowing it to interact seamlessly with [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) standards.
This allows you to interact with the pool units as if they were ERC20 tokens, including transferring them to other addresses, if it is allowed by the pool configuration.
Check the [next section](#important-functions) for more information on pool configurations.

## Important Functions

Here are some of the most important functions provided by `SuperTokenV1Library.sol` for interacting with Superfluid pools:

### createPool

```solidity
function createPool(ISuperToken token, address admin, PoolConfig memory poolConfig)
```

Creates a new pool with the specified admin, configuration and poolConfig.

The `PoolConfig` struct is defined as follows:

```solidity
struct PoolConfig {
    bool transferabilityForUnitsOwner;
    bool distributionFromAnyAddress;
}
```
`transferabilityForUnitsOwner`: If true, the pool members can transfer their owned units, else, only the pool admin can manipulate the units for pool members
`distributionFromAnyAddress`: If true, anyone can execute distributions via the pool, else, only the pool admin can execute distributions via the pool


### updateMemberUnits

```solidity
function updateMemberUnits(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, address memberAddress, uint128 newUnits)
```

Updates the number of units a member has within a pool, effectively changing their share of future distributions.

### claimAll

```solidity
function claimAll(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool, address memberAddress)
```

Allows a member to claim their share of the tokens from all previous distributions.

### connectPool

```solidity
function connectPool(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool)
```

Connects a pool member to a pool.

### disconnectPool

```solidity
function disconnectPool(ISuperToken token, ISuperfluidPool pool)
```

Connects a pool member from a pool.

### distributeToPool

```solidity
function distributeToPool(ISuperToken token, address from, ISuperfluidPool pool, uint256 requestedAmount)
```

Distributes a specified amount of tokens to the pool, to be shared among members according to their units.

## Example Usage

Here's how you might use these functions within a smart contract to set up and manage a pool:

```solidity
// Assume ISuperToken and SuperfluidPool interfaces are imported and available.

contract MyContract {
    ISuperToken private superToken;
    ISuperfluidPool private pool;

    constructor(ISuperToken _superToken) {
        superToken = _superToken;
        pool = SuperTokenV1Library.createPool(_superToken, address(this), poolConfig);
    }

    function addMember(address member, uint128 units) public {
        superToken.updateMemberUnits(_superToken, _pool, member, units);
    }

    function distribute(uint256 amount) public {
        superToken.distributeToPool(_superToken, address(this), _pool, amount);
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyContract` creates a pool, adds a member, and distributes tokens using the functions from `SuperTokenV1Library.sol`.
