# Distributions Overview

Superfluid's distribution system offers two distinct types of distributions - Instant and Streaming - each catering to different use cases within the Superfluid framework.

## Instant Distributions

Instant distributions are discrete, one-time transfers triggered by a transaction on the blockchain. They allow for immediate and proportional distribution of tokens to all members of a pool.

## Streaming Distributions

Streaming distributions utilize the concept of money streaming to transfer value over time from one entity to many. This type of distribution enables a continuous flow of tokens, proportional to the units held by each member.

## Overview

Distributions in Superfluid enable scalable, recurring one-to-many token distributions at a fixed gas cost. By assigning units to receivers, tokens can be distributed to multiple recipients efficiently.

### How It Works

1. **Publishing an Index or a Pool**: A publisher creates a distribution channel.
2. **Assigning Proportions**: The publisher sets proportions by allocating units to subscribers or pool members.
3. **Distributing Tokens**: Subscribers receive tokens based on their unit holdings.

Distributions are persistent, allowing multiple triggers with varying amounts. Units can be adjusted as needed.

## Key Concepts

- **Index/Pool**: Channels for proportional token distribution.
- **Publisher/Pool Admin**: Initiates the distribution process.
- **Subscribers/Pool Members**: Receivers allocated units for distribution.

## Balancing Formula

Calculates the current balance of an account subscribed to one or more distribution Indices.

## Pool Administration and Member Participation

Pool admins manage units and distributions, while members receive distributions based on their units.

### Distribution Types

- **Instant Distribution**: One-time proportional token allocation.
- **Streaming Distribution**: Continuous flow of tokens over time.

### Major Design Choices

- **Pool Administration**: Admins have control over unit management and token distribution.
- **Member Participation**: Members receive distributions proportionate to their units.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: The Pool interacts seamlessly with ERC20 standards.

## Solvency Mechanism and Adjustment Flow

Ensures a secure system for token flow and fair distribution among pool members.
