# Interact On-Chain

This guide delves into the specifics of Superfluid's smart contract functions, offering step-by-step guidance and practical insights for developers.

## Direct Interaction Functions

<Admonition type="info">
  These functions allow direct interactions with Super Tokens, providing real-time information about ongoing flows.
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="getFlowInfo" label="getFlowInfo">
### `getFlowInfo`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function getFlowInfo(ISuperToken token, address sender, address receiver)
    internal view
    returns(uint256 lastUpdated, int96 flowRate, uint256 deposit, uint256 owedDeposit)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Retrieve flow information, such as the rate and deposit details, between two accounts for a given Super Token. Useful for tracking and auditing ongoing streams.
    
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="getFlowRate" label="getFlowRate">

### `getFlowRate`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function getFlowRate(ISuperToken token, address sender, address receiver)
    internal view returns(int96 flowRate)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Use this function to quickly check the current flow rate between two accounts. Ideal for applications that need to display or make calculations based on live flow rates.
    
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="getNetFlowRate" label="getNetFlowRate">

### `getNetFlowRate`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function getNetFlowRate(ISuperToken token, address account)
    internal view returns (int96 flowRate)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Determine the net flow rate (inflow minus outflow) of a specific account. Essential for balancing and financial planning within the Superfluid ecosystem.
     
        </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Functions with User Data and Context

<Admonition type="tip">
  These advanced functions allow passing additional `userData` for custom operations and require context handling in Super App callbacks.
</Admonition>

### User Data Overload

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
// Same function call just with additional parameter for user data
token.createFlow(address receiver, int96 flowRate, bytes memory userData);
token.updateFlow(address receiver, int96 flowRate, bytes memory userData);
token.deleteFlow(address sender, address receiver, bytes memory userData);
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Attach custom `userData` to your flow transactions. This feature is crucial for applications that require additional data to be transmitted or stored with each flow operation.

### Context in Super App Callbacks

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`
function onFlowCreated(ISuperToken superToken, address sender, bytes calldata ctx)
    internal override returns (bytes memory /*newCtx*/) {
    // ... callback logic
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: In Super App callbacks, use context (`ctx`) to manage state throughout the flow lifecycle. This is particularly important for apps that react to flow creations, updates, or deletions.

## Access Control List Functions

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="setFlowPermissions" label="setFlowPermissions">

### `setFlowPermissions`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function setFlowPermissions(
    ISuperToken token,
    address flowOperator,
    bool allowCreate,
    bool allowUpdate,
    bool allowDelete,
    int96 flowRateAllowance
) internal returns (bool)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Grant specific flow permissions to an operator. This function is key for delegating flow management responsibilities, similar to setting allowances in ERC20 tokens.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="setMaxFlowPermissions" label="setMaxFlowPermissions">

### `setMaxFlowPermissions`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function setMaxFlowPermissions(
    ISuperToken token,
    address flowOperator
) internal returns (bool)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Quickly grant an operator maximum permissions over your Super Token flows. Ideal for trusted operators where maximum flexibility is required.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="revokeFlowPermissions" label="revokeFlowPermissions">

### `revokeFlowPermissions`

<CodeBlock language="solidity">
{`
function revokeFlowPermissions(
    ISuperToken token,
    address flowOperator
) internal returns (bool)
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Usage**: Use this function to revoke previously granted permissions, enhancing security and control over your Super Token flows.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
