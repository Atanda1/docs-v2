# Overview

## What is the Superfluid SDK?

The Superfluid SDK-Core is a wrapper library around `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts` which allows 
web developers to interact with the Superfluid contracts.
Under the hood, SDK-Core leverages TypeScript, ethers.js and The Graph and GraphQL.
The chapters of this page provide an overview on how to use the SDK core to
interact with the protocol.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: The most notable feature of Superfluid is the ability to stream tokens continuously over time, rather than in discrete transactions.
- **Programmable Cashflows**: It allows the creation of cash flows that are programmable and composable, providing a high degree of flexibility and automation.
- **Versatility**: The SDK is compatible with various EVM-based networks and is designed to be both developer-friendly and highly adaptable to different use cases.

## Capabilities and Use Cases

- **Continuous Payments**: Ideal for subscriptions, salaries, or rent, where payments can be streamed per second rather than monthly.
- **Reward Distributions**: Stream or send rewards to multiple participants in real-time, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution system.
- **Continuous DCA**: Seamlessly Dollar-cost-average (DCA) every second in your favourite asset without the need for complex and costly transactions.

## Getting Started with the SDK

The SDK is designed to be intuitive and accessible for developers:

```javascript
import { Framework } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk-core";
// Framework initialization code
```

* **Framework Initialization**: Begin by creating a Framework instance, which is the entry point to interact with Superfluid features.
* **Token Operations**: Manage Super Tokens, perform upgrades, downgrades, and transfers.
* **Agreement Operations**: Utilize CFA and IDA for streaming and distributing tokens.

## Conclusion

The Superfluid SDK is a potent tool for developers looking to harness the power of real-time finance on the blockchain. By enabling new models of financial transactions, it paves the way for innovative applications and more efficient systems in the DeFi space.
