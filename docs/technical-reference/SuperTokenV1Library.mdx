# SuperTokenV1Library

**Library for Token Centric Interface**

Set `using for ISuperToken` in including file, and call any of these functions on an instance
of ISuperToken.
Note that it is important to "warm up" the cache and cache the host, cfa, ida before calling,
this is only applicable to Foundry tests where the vm.expectRevert() will not work as expected.
You must use vm.startPrank(account) instead of vm.prank when executing functions if the cache
isn't "warmed up" yet. vm.prank impersonates the account only for the first call, which will be
used for caching.

## Fn distribute

```solidity
function distribute(
    contract ISuperToken token,
    uint32 indexId,
    uint256 amount
)
    internal
    returns (bool)
```

 _Distributes tokens in a more developer friendly way than `updateIndex`. Instead of
passing the new total index value, you pass the amount of tokens desired to be distributed._ 

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| `token` | contract ISuperToken | Super Token used with the index. |
|  |  |  |
| `indexId` | uint32 | ID of the index. |
|  |  |  |
| `amount` | uint256 | - total number of tokens desired to be distributed
NOTE in many cases, there can be some precision loss
     This may cause a slight difference in the amount param specified and the actual amount distributed.
     See below for math:
     //indexDelta = amount the index will be updated by during an internal call to _updateIndex().
     It is calculated like so:
     indexDelta = amount / totalUnits
     (see the distribute() implementatation in ./agreements/InstantDistributionAgreement.sol)
NOTE Solidity does not support floating point numbers
     So the indexDelta will be rounded down to the nearest integer.
     This will create a 'remainder' amount of tokens that will not be distributed
     (we'll call this the 'distribution modulo')
     distributionModulo = amount - indexDelta * totalUnits
NOTE due to rounding, there may be a small amount of tokens left in the publisher's account
     This amount is equal to the 'distributionModulo' value
