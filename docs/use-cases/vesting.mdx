# Vesting with Superfluid

Superfluid introduces an easy-to-use, liquid, and composable vesting tool, offering a sleek, no-code vesting solution alongside a robust smart contract framework for developers. Hereâ€™s how you can create a vesting schedule using the Superfluid Dashboard or by leveraging the Superfluid Vesting Scheduler.

## Prerequisites

- A web3 wallet with sufficient Tokens to vest.
- Access to the [Superfluid Dashboard](app.superfluid.finance).
- Vesting terms such as cliffs, vesting periods, and streams.


## Vesting with the Superfluid Dashboard (No-code)

### Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to the [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/vesting). Ensure you are connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Polygon Mumbai for testing or Ethereum mainnet for live transactions).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/dashboard-vesting.png" alt="Vesting Dashboard" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

### Step 2: Creating the Vesting Schedule
Fill in the information below in order to create a vesting schedule:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-schedule.gif" alt="Create Vesting Schedule" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>
1. **Receiver**: Enter the public address, ENS, or Lens of the recipient.
2. **Super Token**: Select the Super Token you wish to vest.
3. **Vesting Start Date**: Set the date and time when the vesting will start.
4. **Total Vested Amount**: Input the total amount of tokens to be vested.
5. **Total Vesting Period**: Specify the duration over which the tokens will vest.
6. **Optional Cliff**: Toggle the 'Add Cliff' option and specify the cliff amount and period if needed.

### Step 3: Preview and Create

After entering the vesting parameters, preview the vesting schedule to ensure everything is correct. Then, create the vesting schedule with a single transaction.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-preview.png" alt="Vesting Preview" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

### Step 4: Sharing the Vesting Schedule

A link to the vesting schedule status page can be shared with the recipient, providing them with an up-to-date view of their vesting progress.
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-page.png" alt="Vesting Custom Page" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

## Vesting using the Superfluid Vesting Scheduler (for Devs)

The Vesting Scheduler is a sophisticated smart contract designed for setting up token vesting schedules.
It's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient.
The contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream,
ensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.

For a more detailed explanation of the Vesting Scheduler, check out the Vesting Scheduler Automation [Full Guide](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/automations/vesting-scheduler).
